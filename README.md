# My Nixos Configuration

Nixos is a rabbit hole that I have been wanting to go down for a while.

## WIP

This nixos configuration is a work in progress. I am currently using it on my personal laptop, but
it is not yet ready for use on other machines. I am still learning Nix and NixOS, so I am sure there
are many improvements that can be made. I will update this README as I make progress.
